      <h2>Rules of the game:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>How to win:</b><br>
        Each player starts the game with 30 life points and 20 cards in the deck. <br>
        To defeat your opponent, you need to drop his life points to 0.<br>
        <b>Summon Stage:</b><br>
        Each player can place 1 unit and 1 spell on their turn, once placed, the effect of the card is activated.
        Once the turn ends, all of his cards are going to attack their opponent's cards in the same position on the field.<br>
        <b>Battle Stage:</b><br>
        If the attacking unit has more attack than the defending unit defense, the unit on the defending side will be destroyed.<br>
        If the attacking unit has less attack than the defending unit defense, the attacker loses 2 life points.<br>
        If there is no unit defending, the defending side is going to take all attacking unit attack points as direct damage to its life points.
